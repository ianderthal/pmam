										<h2>Birth of the PMAM</h2>
										<p>Written by Norberto A. Sugayan, M.D.<br>
											PMAM Founding President, 1964
										</p>
									</header>

									<p>
										The Philippine Medical Association of Michigan (PMAM) was formed as a branch of the Philippine Medical Association in America (PMAA) as part of its program of expansion spearheaded by its then president, Ernesto Palanca, Jr. M.D. In 1964 there were 5 state branches formed which included the following states and their capital cities:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Baltimore, Maryland (President - Graciano Cendena, M.D.)</li>
										<li>Boston, Massachusetts (President - Rolando Navarro, M.D.)</li>
										<li>Chicago, Illinois (President - Rodolfo Jao, M.D.)</li>
										<li>St. Louis, Missouri (President - Bernabe Banson, M.D.)</li>
										<li>Detroit, Michigan (President - Norberto Sugayan, M.D.)</li>
									</ul>
									<p>The Michigan Chapter was formed on April 18, 1964 with the following officers:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>President - Norberto Sugayan, M.D.</li>
										<li>1<sup>st</sup> Vice President Aralar, M.D.</li>
										<li>2<sup>nd</sup> Vice President Rodolfo Loo, M.D.</li>
										<li>Secretary - Aquiles G. Lira, M.D.</li>
										<li>Asst. Secretary - Gil Mediodina, M.D.</li>
										<li>Treasurer - Carlos Romero, M.D.</li>
										<li>Asst. Treasurer - Ligorio Calacay, M.D.</li>
										<li>Business Manager - Isaias Villarosa, M.D.</li>
										<li>PRO - Hermenigildo Labsan, M.D.</li>
										<li>Councilors - Romulo Ancog, M.D., Florante Bocobo, M.D., Peligny Camacho, M.D., and Emiliano Rivera, M.D.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>At that time there were a lot of Filipino doctors in the metro Detroit area, mostly in the exchange visitors program. 95% were interns or in a 2 to 4 year residency programs. There were only, at the most, 16 Filipino doctors in medical practice including myself. I wrote the first newsletter to all the Filipino doctors in all the hospitals in Michigan announcing the formation of the  PMAM, Michigan Chapter and asked them to join. As a result of the enthusiastic response, I appointed one representative from each of the 23 hospitals that had Filipino physicians in their training program to complement the 12 officers elected with me. Meetings were scheduled monthly and were satisfactorily attended, being held alternatively in officers' homes and later on at the International Institute in Detroit. In retrospect, I can now appreciate the relative ease of my tenure. There was no fiscal responsibility for there was no money to begin with. It may be assumed that the PMAM was subsidized by the officers because they were affluent "moonlighters".
									</p>
									<p>Social gatherings were frequent but well-spaced and well attended, probably because of their need to mingle with their kind far away from home.</p>
									<p>Formation of the Women's Auxiliary to the PMAM was on August 1, 1964 which significantly enhanced the participation in the association's activities.</p>

										<h2>PMAM's Legacy</h2>
										<p>Written by Doree Ann V. Espiritu, M.D.

									<p>The PMAM Medical Mission was held in Laoag City, Philippines from January 18-21, 2010.  The group consisted of 103 hard-working volunteers who served close to 3,000 patients during this four-day mission.  While in Laoag City, I had to buy some office supplies for the mission at a bazaar and as I paid the bill, the store owner informed me that he was going to give me 10% discount off my purchases and this took me by surprise.  He informed me that this was nothing compared to what the PMAM is doing for the people of Ilocos Norte by bringing the mission to Laoag City.  This sentiment was echoed over and over as the mission progressed for 4 days.</p>

									<p>All too often, while we as officers and members are in the thick of fund-raising activities, we tend to forget the real essence of what the PMAM has done in the past 46 years.   I have not been with PMAM that long but after coming back from the mission, I was filled with such appreciation that I felt compelled to write about how I feel about PMAM.  I would therefore like to take a stab of how PMAM has influenced the lives of the community we serve by taking a conservative estimate of the outcomes of our activities in the past years:</p>
 
									<p><strong>Medical Mission:</strong> Since 1990, the PMAM has conducted medical missions every year (except during Dr. Only Sison’s administration during the Lahar flood) to different regions in the Philippines including the Mountain Province, Cabanatuan, Batangas, Zambales, Bulacan, Quezon City, Pampanga, Ilocos Norte, and many more deprived areas. If we take a conservative estimate of around 2,500 medical, pediatric and surgical patients seen per year, PMAM would have already served <strong>22,500</strong> patients in 9 years. Majority of the physicians who join the mission have been going home every year, at their own personal expense, to serve. This would mean more than <strong>20,000 </strong> volunteer hours for physician time alone.</p>
 
									<p><strong>Health Expo:</strong> This was started during the administration of Dr. Tony de Leon in 2005.  This was aimed as an outreach to our local Filipino and Asian Communities which aims to screen for chronic illnesses and educate the community about preventative care. If we have seen around 140 patients at the PACCM every year since, we would have already seen around 700 Asian patients in Northeast Michigan offering them medical, dental, and other specialty services for free.</p>
 
									<p><strong>Center for Migrant Youth:</strong> Under Dr. Ostrea’s initiative, $1,000.00 from the Thanksgiving Mass offerings has been donated to Father Ruben Villote’s Center for Migrant Youth in the Philippines. Twenty-two years ago, Fr. Ben Villote took a significant turn in his ministry when he left the comforts of his parish and, instead, put up the Center for Migrant Youth (CMY). The center took into its fold stowaways from the provinces, wandering Manila’s streets dirty, hungry and hopeless. Young men aged 15-20 walked into the center to have a meal, take a bath and, perhaps, for the first time feel loved. CMY’s address in 103 Cordillera St., QC, has become a home for the hopeless who find there a haven of hope. Five generations of youth have become professionals-as seafarers, overseas workers, educators, drivers, computer technicians, and even small entrepreneurs and entertainers (Vincentian Family News 1, 2005).  In addition, since Dr. Claire Perez’ administration until Dr. Cecile Switzer’s 2009, PMAM has sponsored a scholar in Father Villote’s program to assist the young man in his College education.</p>
 
									<p><strong>Scholarships:</strong> Prior to selecting a Filipino student as a recipient of PMAM scholarship, PMAM has awarded several cash prizes for deserving high school students in Michigan.</p>
 
									<p>Other Charitable activities: PMAM has always been a very generous donor to many fundraising activities locally and abroad thru the American Red Cross and Filipino organizations.  Some of our Presidents have contributed to finance building homes for our less fortunate countrymen like Gawad Kalinga (thru Dr. Claire Perez) and Municipality of Cabarbaran (thru Dr. Tony de Leon). </p>
 
									<p>The PMAM, after 46 years of existence, has served and touched hundreds of thousands of people without even knowing it.  I think the members could say with pride that the PMAM has raised funds for these projects from individual members with very little corporate sponsors if any.</p>
 
									<p>
										Mrs. V.L. who underwent a major surgery in Laoag City wrote: “…a million thanks to God who gave power to your hands and make miracle doctors like you. I hope and pray for the continuing power within your hands to help and do more for people like me…”<br>
										Mr. M.A. wrote: “…thank you for all your patience and kindness.  I saw in your eyes your willingness to help poor Filipinos who are suffering from painful diseases. Your medical mission really inspires all Filipinos. May God bless you all…”
									</p>
 
									<p>Contrary to the above comments, I have heard countless times from non-PMAM members that PMAM is nothing but a “social organization” which hosts fancy inaugural balls, Christmas parties and picnics.  Some young physicians who are prospective members of PMAM shy away because they do not see the concrete benefits that PMAM could offer them.  This humble review of the services PMAM has rendered all these years proves that PMAM is more than just what other people deem it is.  After all, I did not need to travel thousands of miles to be reminded of the magnanimity of what PMAM has done. I am proud to be a member because I do not know of a lot of organizations which could offer so much with so little tangible resources. The biggest hidden resource of our organization is the collective willingness to help and the passion to work so the less fortunate could benefit.  The PMAM allows each member to reach out and serve thousands of people by just being a member. If this is not enough reason to be a proud member of PMAM, I don’t know what is. </p>

										<h2 id="community">Community—the Heart of the PMAM</h2>
										<p>Written by Emmanuel Dizon, MD - President</p>
									</header>
									<p>"The heart of PMAM has always been the dedication of its members to serve and be a support and community to one another.  Having grown up in Michigan all my life, I have witnessed how the PMAM helped be that vital support for my parents who were young immigrant doctors.  Arriving in the United States in 1968 my parents faced a very different reality to today.  I applaud the courage of the many immigrants who came during that time, leaving everything familiar and safe to come to a place that could be very isolating and at times not welcoming to foreigners.</p>

									<p>The PMAM helped provide that sense of community back in those days for the young physicians.  It was a place where they could connect with fellow Filipinos, commiserate, and share the joys and challenges of being in the United States.   I remember my parents hosting some of their friends at those early Christmas parties back in the 1970s.  These experiences forged strong ties and friendships that lasted a lifetime.  The PMAM gave us a sense of community as Filipino-Americans, a knowing that we were not alone in an unfamiliar country.</p>
											
									<p>Throughout the years the PMAM has served the community in many ways.  Events such as the picnic, Christmas parties helped to continue the sense of community and belonging.  In addition, the PMAM has conducted medical missions in the Philippines.  These began in the 1980s and served as a way to give back to our loved ones back home.  Many of the members have also conducted medical missions on their own due to the many needs of the indigent Filipinos. </p>
											
									<p>The PMAM and its members have been active in their support of organizations that promote, foster, and develop the Filipino community in Michigan.  I can see the legacy and imprint of current and past PMAM members in our community.  We have active members who serve in leadership roles in groups such as the Philippine American Cultural Center of Michigan or PACCM.  We play direct roles in community events such as the Thanksgiving Mass which brings together our Filipino community in a celebration of God and family every year.</p>
											
									<p>Recently we have lent support to community events such as the Filipino Basket Association of North America’s Basketball tournament sponsored by the Filipino-American Sports Teams of Detroit or FAST-D.  Our members have also tried to be that support for some of the newer arrivals who have come facing the many challenges that new immigrants face.  Recently some of our members have lent a hand to the new teachers who have arrived from the Philippines, many of whom have come not having any family or social support. </p>
											
									<p>As the group has matured, we have experienced the loss of our members who have passed on. I have witnessed firsthand, the coming together of our group to support and pray for the grieving families.  I hear the conversations and the fond memories that keep bonds strong and vital over the years.  It touches me when I speak with both older members and current members about their passion and their dedication to one another.</p>
											
									<p>Community is really the heart of the PMAM.  We are a community of dedicated, caring individuals who serve together, have fun together, laugh together, cry together, pray together, love together.   As a group and as individual members, we have served our Filipino community both here in Michigan and back home.  We hold fun events such as the Christmas parties, picnics, and sponsor golf outings.  Some may think such activities are not important and are just about being social.  I would beg to differ.  It is the coming together that builds the ties, strengthens bonds, and forges friendships.  We live in an age of social media, Facebook, Instagram and the like—yet very few of these interactions are actually face to face.  We need to come together now more than ever.  I merely have to go back to the time when my parents hosted a group of young resident physicians in their house for Christmas.  How much did it mean to them at that time?   It is my sincere hope and desire that we continue to build our community for both the current generation as well as our future.  That is the legacy that we carry and give to our younger generations."</p>
